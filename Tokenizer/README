1. The top 9 words seem to follow everyday words such as: her, i, she, not, you, his, had, but, have. It is only the
tenth word, "elanor", which has a direct correlation to the story as it is the name of one of the main characters. The
top words continue to follow typical everyday non-book-content related words with sparse relevant names such as
marriane, dashword, edward. Throughout all the 100 words there was not a single reference to the name of the book, with
no real emphasis on words that are directly related to the context of the book, the only words that are in the list are
names of people or places and the word "sister" or "mother", otherwise the rest of the words barely relate or give
context about the book.
2. Personal pronouns should definitely be used as stopwords, as they take most of the top 10 words spots without giving
real context about the book. Words that are also demonstrative pronouns such as that, which, what, etc, should also be
removed. The stemmer sometimes stems words that should not be stemmed such as names, as the example of "willoughbi"
which refers to Willoughby. When the words is the name of a place, the stemmer takes away important context.
3. Graph is attached in the files
4. Using the graphs at pages 81 and 82 of the textbook as references, I think sense and sensibility follows heaps law as
the curve seem to start at a sharp angle with a high slope and gradually start to decrease the slope of the curve,
meaning that as more words enter the collection, less and less new words are encountered, leading to the skewed curve as
observed.
